# Property Finding and Adding Web-App

This is my first attempt to create a complete Full-Stack Web Application that has both frontend and Backend attached to it.
### Purpose of this app

This App mainly focuses on the pain points of students through which they can find properties for their accomodation.
## The Pictures of working App

This is a website with some exciting functionality 

Due to the existence of the database, it cannot be hosted on GitHub
I will link the video . You can dowload the source code and work it out on your own using XAMMP.

## FrontEnd-Section

This is the video of the working Web-App:
